# Athanor — Ambassador (Referral) FAQ

_How to share Athanor responsibly and earn rewards._  
_For binding terms, see the Ambassador Program Terms, ToS, and Privacy Policy._

---

## 1) What is the Ambassador program?

A simple referral program. Any **user in good standing** can opt in, get a **unique link + code**, and earn a **commission on Athanor’s platform revenue** generated by their invited users’ **fees** (e.g., GemScore passes/subscriptions, Explorer Passes, Advisor‑marketplace fees). It’s **not** tied to investment amounts.

---

## 2) Who can join?

Anyone **18+** with an Athanor account who completes any required **KYC/AML** and isn’t in a **restricted region** (e.g., RF, North Korea, Iran, plus any other blocked jurisdictions). “Ambassador” is a **program label**, not a separate platform role.

---

## 3) How much do I earn?

- **Default rate:** **20%** of **Eligible Platform Revenue** from your invitees (see Terms for the precise definition).
    
- **Lifetime attribution:** once a user is attributed to you, future eligible purchases by that user continue to earn (unless attribution is corrected within 7 days at the invitee’s request).
    
- **What’s excluded:** **no commission** on invested principal, or on **issuance/success** fees in the public program. (VIPs may negotiate different economics by separate agreement.)

**Examples (with current pricing):**

- Invitee buys a **GemScore report for $39** → you earn **20% × $39 = $7.80** (net of any taxes/discounts).
    
- Invitee (as Advisor) completes a **$5,000** engagement → Athanor collects an **8%** fee (**$400**), you earn **20% × $400 = $80**.

_(Prices may change; always refer to the current in‑app price.)_

---

## 4) How does tracking work?

- You receive a **unique link and code**.
    
- Attribution occurs when your invitee **signs up** or **checks out** using your link **or** enters your **code**. If multiple codes are present, the **code actually entered at the action** wins.
    
- **No cookie gymnastics.** We keep it simple to avoid disputes.
    
- **Corrections:** invitees can request a one‑time attribution change within **7 days** of sign‑up/first purchase.

---

## 5) When and how do I get paid?

- **Monthly**, **manual** payouts in **fiat or crypto** (as available).
    
- A **minimum payout threshold** may apply; unpaid balances roll forward.
    
- You’ll see a **statement** in the Ambassador Panel showing your attributed revenue and commission.
    
- **Clawbacks/adjustments** (refunds, chargebacks, fraud) are netted from future payouts.

---

## 6) What can I promote?

- Educational content about **Launchpad**, **Abyss**, **GemScore**, **Data Rooms**, and how to configure a **Tokenized Promise**.
    
- Public product pages and your **referral link**.
    
- We can provide **promo materials** (logos, screenshots, copy blocks) **on request**.

---

## 7) What am I **not** allowed to do?

- **No investment solicitation** and **no investment advice**. Do not promise returns, recommend specific securities, or act as a finder.
    
- **No sharing of non‑public Data Room content.**
    
- **No spam or deception:** bots, mass DMs, fake reviews, brand bidding, typo domains, or pretending to be Athanor staff.
    
- **No geo/KYC evasion.**
    
- **Comply with ad laws** and include clear referral disclosures.

**Fast disclosure you can reuse:**

> “This is a referral link — I may receive a commission from platform fees if you buy Athanor services. Not investment advice. Startups and digital assets carry high risk, including total loss.”

---

## 8) Can I also be a Founder, Investor, or Advisor?

Yes. You cannot earn referral commissions on **your own** purchases or accounts you control. If you are also an **Advisor**, remember Advisors **cannot invest from the same account**; open a **separate Investor account** if you want to invest, and disclose conflicts.

---

## 9) Do you have a VIP track?

Yes. **Syndicates, VC funds, angel groups/boards** can email support for **VIP review** (custom rate, co‑marketing, or different economics by **signed addendum**). Public program rules still apply unless superseded by that addendum.

---

## 10) What channels work best?

- **Owned channels:** newsletters, blogs, podcasts, YouTube, LinkedIn/X threads.
    
- **Communities:** founder groups, builder discords/slacks (follow their rules).
    
- **Educational formats:** “How to run GemScore,” “Designing milestone‑based raises,” “What’s a Data Room?”

Avoid channel types that usually trigger spam flags (coupon farms, comment spam, mass DMs).

---

## 11) Common pitfalls to avoid

- Linking to **private** pages/screenshots.
    
- Forgetting the **disclosure** line.
    
- Framing posts as **returns or guarantees** rather than product education.
    
- Promoting from or to **blocked regions**.
    
- Using paid search to **bid on Athanor trademarks**.

---

## 12) Quick start checklist

-  Create account, complete **KYC/AML**.
    
-  Enable **Ambassador** in your profile; copy your **link + code**.
    
-  Request **promo kit** if needed.
    
-  Publish one clean explainer with disclosure.
    
-  Share to your audience; answer questions; point to public/how‑to pages.
    
-  Track earnings in the **Ambassador Panel**; set payout method.
