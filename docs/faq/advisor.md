# Athanor — Advisor FAQ

_How to list services, work with Founders, and stay compliant._  
_For binding terms, see the ToS, Privacy Policy, and any Statement of Work (SOW) you agree with a Founder._

---

## 0) General

- We currently capped with **500 Advisors** across product, engineering, AI/ML, security, compliance, GTM, and certifications. On-chain reputation is used to off-board bad actors.
    
- **Advisor setup is manual in beta.** After you complete onboarding, **contact support** to confirm your eligibility to publish services.
    
- **Payments:** the **Founder pays you directly** (off‑platform). **You must remit 8%** of each order (or milestone payment) **to Athanor**.
    
- **Accounts:** you **cannot invest from your Advisor account**. If you want to invest, create a **separate Investor account** (with its own KYC) and disclose any conflicts.

## 1) Who can become an Advisor?

Anyone with relevant expertise who completes **KYC**, agrees to the ToS/Privacy Policy, and passes our **manual eligibility review** during beta.

---

## 2) How do I get listed — step by step?

1. **Create an Advisor profile** and complete **KYC**.
    
2. Prepare **service offers** with a clear SOW (scope, deliverables, acceptance criteria, timeline, pricing).
    
3. **Contact support** to finish manual onboarding and confirm eligibility to publish.
    
4. Once approved, your service becomes visible in the **Marketplace** and via invites from **Data Rooms**.

> Tip: Start with one “starter package” (fixed price, tight scope) and one “core package” (broader scope with milestone checkpoints).

---

## 3) How are payments and fees handled in beta?

- **Founder pays you directly** using the method you agree together (bank/crypto/other).
    
- You **self‑remit 8%** of **every payment you receive** on Athanor‑sourced work.
    
- Remit **per the in‑app instructions/invoice**. If you split work into milestones, remit **8% of each milestone payment**.
    
- Non‑payment or late remittance can lead to **de‑listing or account suspension**.

**Example:** Founder pays you $5,000 → you owe **$400** (8%) to Athanor.

---

## 4) Can Advisors invest in deals?

- **Not from the Advisor account.** Create a **separate Investor account** if you choose to invest.
    
- Declare **conflicts of interest** to the Founder (and in your profile).
    
- Investing is still subject to **deal‑level eligibility** (e.g., QI‑only, region blocks) and any conflict policies the Founder sets.

---

## 5) What access do I get to a Founder’s information?

- Use the project’s **Data Room**. Some modules are visible to authorized users; **private modules** (e.g., **Metrics**, **Private Groups**, diligence files) are restricted.
    
- Follow **need‑to‑know**: request only what your SOW requires.
    
- Keep non‑public materials **confidential**; store sensitive files in the Founder’s **Secured Portal**. No scraping or onward sharing.

---

## 6) How should I structure a strong SOW?

- **Outcome:** what changes when you’re done.
    
- **Deliverables:** links, files, dashboards, code PRs, checklists.
    
- **Acceptance criteria:** objective tests.
    
- **Timeline & milestones:** dates and decision points.
    
- **Pricing:** fixed/hourly/retainer; if hourly, include a **cap** and weekly reporting.
    
- **Access & dependencies:** repos, analytics, cloud roles.
    
- **IP & confidentiality:** ownership terms; license (if any).
    
- **Disputes & revisions:** what happens if acceptance fails; rework limits.

---

## 7) What kinds of services work best on Athanor?

- **Product & Engineering:** architecture, agents, integrations, refactors, performance.
    
- **Security & Compliance:** threat models, SOC‑2/GDPR readiness, incident playbooks.
    
- **GTM & Growth:** ICP/positioning, funnels, lifecycle automation, pricing.
    
- **Fundraising Prep & Finance:** story, KPI instrumentation, FP&A models, data room triage.
    
- **Certifications & White‑label builds:** audits, templates, deployable MVPs.

---

## 8) Can I help set Tokenized Promise milestones?

Yes. Propose milestones and **evidence templates** tied to your work. Final milestones are the **Founder’s** call. After launch, changes require **Founder consent** plus the deal’s **holder threshold**.

---

## 9) Do Advisors get any platform‑level protections?

- We can **pause** features or **migrate contracts** to protect users during incidents.
    
- For disputes about your services, the **SOW** governs. Athanor may step in for fraud/abuse but is **not** a party to your contract with the Founder.

---

## 10) What should I avoid?

- Claiming or implying **Athanor endorsement**.
    
- Sharing or exporting **non‑public** Data Room content beyond the SOW.
    
- Bypassing **KYC/AML**, geo‑blocks, or transfer rules.
    
- Engaging in **misrepresentation** (e.g., manipulating metrics).
    
- Offering **regulated advice** (legal/tax/securities) without proper licensing.

---

## 11) Can I work on Shariah‑compliant projects?

Yes. If the Founder enables the **Shariah Module** (e.g., **Musharakah**), ensure your work **avoids riba, excessive uncertainty, gambling, and prohibited sectors**. Follow any **Shariah Advisor’s** guidance and keep records for **purification** when needed.

---

## 12) How do I collaborate day to day?

- Join the project’s **Private Group** for decisions and async updates.
    
- Post a short **weekly update**: done / next / risks.
    
- Attach artifacts (dashboards, PRs, docs) in the Data Room.
    
- If you need sensitive files, request **Secured Portal** access.
    

---

## 13) Who do I contact for help or incidents?

- **Support & onboarding:** in‑app chat or your account email.
- **Security/abuse:** **[coa@athanor.market](mailto:coa@athanor.market)** (safe‑harbor VDP applies).
