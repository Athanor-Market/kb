# Athanor — Investor FAQ

_How to evaluate, fund, and manage Tokenized Promises (TPs) on an OTC, non‑custodial protocol._  
_For binding terms, see the Master ToS, Privacy Policy, and each deal’s Tokenized Promise Agreement (TPA)._

---

## 1) What is Athanor for an investor?

Athanor is an **over‑the‑counter (OTC)** marketplace and protocol where **Founders** publish **Data Rooms** and issue **Tokenized Promises (TPs)**. You can review materials (including an AI **GemScore Report**), join **Private Groups** to ask questions or request milestone tweaks, and fund using **USDT‑TON**. Athanor runs the tooling; **Founders’ SPVs** are the issuers.

---

## 2) What do I need before I invest?

- **Account + KYC/AML** (required to invest and to claim any payouts).
- **Non‑custodial TON wallet** (for receiving TP units and making claims).
- **Optional tier** (Free / paid tiers) to adjust your **discounts, monthly limits, and active TP limits** — check the **Investor Cabinet** in‑app for current details.
- **Jurisdiction & eligibility** (UCV settings may require **QI** status or block your region).

---

## 3) How do I evaluate a project quickly and well?

1. **Open the Data Room.** Read the public summary, then check **private modules** if you have access.
    
2. **Scan GemScore (GSR).** Note the overall score (0–100), the 10 factor breakdown, and the “fixes” list. GSR is **informational — not advice**.
    
3. **Check the Term Sheet.** What instrument (**Revenue‑Share** or **Equity/SAFE/SAFT**), Soft/Hard Cap, Raise Window, fees **allocation**, governance thresholds, and **Sensitive‑Access** ticket.
    
4. **Read Milestones.** Each should be **objective**, have evidence, a deadline, and a **max unlock %**.
    
5. **Confirm UCV settings.** Are you allowed (QI‑only? U.S. path chosen? Any country blocks? Min/max ticket?)
    
6. **Ask in the Private Group.** Clarify metrics, pipeline, security, or request milestone adjustments. Founder consent + holder threshold is required for any change.

---

## 4) How do I invest, step by step?

1. **Link your wallet** and complete **KYC**.
    
2. **Choose your tier** (optional) if you want higher limits.
    
3. Explore Abyss for interesting projects
    
4. Dive deeper into Data Room of the selected project
    
5. **Fund in USDT‑TON** from your wallet **or** send from an exchange directly to the TP address.
    
6. **Important:** TP units are deliverable **only** to a verified **non‑custodial wallet**. If you funded from an exchange without linking a wallet, your units sit **in‑contract** (non‑transferable) until you link one.
    
7. **Track status** in your portfolio; monitor milestone progress and Data Room updates.

---

## 5) What fees might I pay?

- **Issuance fee — 2%** and **Success fee — 7%** exist at the platform level, but **each event is charged once** and the **Founder/Investor split is configurable** per deal so that the pieces **sum to the fee** (e.g., 1% + 1% issuance; 3% + 4% success).
    
- Your **invest tier** may also include **monthly limits**; see **Investor Cabinet** for current numbers.

---

## 6) What are my rights as an investor?

- **Disclosure & updates** via the Data Room.
    
- **Milestone oversight** — you can **request** changes in a Private Group; changes require **Founder consent** and the **holder threshold** set in the TPA.
    
- **Sensitive‑Access** (if your **aggregate ticket** ≥ the deal’s threshold): right to request reasonable access to sensitive materials via the Issuer’s **Secured Portal** within the SLA.
    
- **Evidence / audit** — CoA may request evidence at any time and may audit the Issuer; you can reference that process in discussions.
    
- **Refunds on breach** — after Soft Cap, if the **Issuer breaches** (e.g., misses a milestone beyond the cure window), **remaining Escrow** can be refunded **pro‑rata** after applicable fees.

---

## 7) What’s the difference between instruments?

**Revenue‑Share**

- You receive a **% of Net Revenue** on a set cadence (monthly/quarterly).
    
- Deals may include a **Minimum Payment Threshold**, **holdback** for refunds/chargebacks, and an **ROI cap** (e.g., 3×).
    
- Payouts are **pull‑claim** — you claim when the contract shows funds available.

**Equity / SAFE / SAFT**

- **Direct Equity** gives a fixed **equity %**; **SAFE** converts on a future financing or liquidity event (check **cap**, **discount**, **pro‑rata/MFN**).
    
- **SAFT** relates to future tokens; confirm scope, delivery conditions, and compliance limits.

---

## 8) How do milestone unlocks work?

Funds sit in **Escrow**. When a milestone’s **objective evidence** is verified, up to its **max unlock %** is released to the Founder. During open beta, **CoA** verifies evidence and triggers state changes; protocol oracles/governance may take over later.

---

## 9) Can I withdraw or get a refund?

- **Before Soft Cap** — yes, you can **withdraw anytime** (you pay network gas; any incurred platform fees aren’t returned).
    
- **After Soft Cap** — refunds only if the **Founder breaches** and then only from **remaining Escrow**, less fees.

---

## 10) What about taxes and reporting?

You’re responsible for your **own taxes** and recordkeeping. Export statements from your portfolio. Athanor is **not** a tax adviser.

---

## 11) What is QI and why might I need it?

Investor status is **binary**: **QI** or **non‑QI**. The Issuer may require **QI‑only** participation (for example, to use a particular U.S. exemption). If **U.S. Exemption = N/A** for the deal, **U.S. persons are blocked** from interacting with that TP.

---

## 12) How do I claim distributions?

When the Issuer sends revenue to the contract and the deal reaches a distribution event, the **Claim** button appears. Connect your wallet, confirm, and pay gas. Claims remain available; there’s no forced expiry unless the TPA says otherwise.

---

## 13) What if the deal is Shariah‑compliant?

Some TPs enable a **Shariah Module**. The default pattern is **Musharakah (joint venture)**: profits share by an agreed ratio; **losses are per capital**; **no riba / maysir / excessive gharar** and prohibited sectors are excluded. Incidental non‑compliant income is **purified** to a disclosed wallet. Read the **Shariah schedule** in the TPA if this matters to you.

---

## 14) What are red flags to watch for?

- **Vague milestones** (no evidence, no deadlines).
    
- **Ambiguous “Net Revenue”** definitions or missing holdback logic.
    
- **UCV mis‑configuration** (no U.S. path but still marketing to U.S. persons).
    
- **Sparse Metrics** with no way to verify (and no Sensitive‑Access plan).
    
- **Founder unwilling to use Private Group** or to post updates.
    
- **Too‑high caps** relative to the next 90‑day milestone plan.

---

## 15) Can I resell or transfer my units?

**Secondary transfers are disabled** at launch. If they open later, transfers will require KYC/QI checks and may be **whitelist‑only** under the UCV rules.

---

## 16) What risks should I assume?

High risk, including **total loss**. Smart‑contract bugs, chain halts/forks, oracle or processor failures, Founder under‑performance, and regulatory changes are all possible. There is **no insurance fund** at launch and **no guarantee** of conversion, liquidity, or distributions.

---

## 17) What behavior is not allowed?

No fraud or market manipulation; no scraping/export of non‑public Data Room content; no bypassing KYC/AML or geographic blocks; no implying Athanor endorsement. Respect community rules in Private Groups.

---

## 18) How do I escalate issues or report security problems?

Use in‑app support for general issues. For security or abuse, email **[coa@athanor.market](mailto:coa@athanor.market)**. We may **pause features** or **migrate contracts** to protect users if needed.
