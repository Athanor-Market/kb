# Athanor — Founder FAQ

_Practical answers for listing, issuing, and running a Tokenized Promise (TP)._  
_For binding terms, read the Master ToS, Privacy Policy, and your Tokenized Promise Agreement (TPA)._

---

## 1) What do I need before I list my project?

- **Founder account + KYC.** Required to list and configure a TP.
    
- **Non‑custodial TON wallet.** Used to receive milestone releases and to deploy your TP. (Hardware wallets like **Tangem** are recommended but optional.)
    
- **GemScore Pass.** Needed to run GemSeeker AI (GSAI). Projects with **GemScore ≥ 40** can be **Listed in Abyss**.
    
- **SPV plan.** If not formed yet, you’ll form it right after Soft Cap.

---

## 2) How do I submit my project in Launchpad — step by step?

1. **Open Launchpad.** This is where your projects live.
    
2. **Click “Submit.”** You’ll see a notice about AI evaluation; click **“Let’s start.”**
    
3. **Choose your input mode.**
    
    - **Recommended:** fill the form from scratch, or
    - Upload a **pitch deck / audio / video** — the system will **pre‑fill** the same form for you to review.
        
4. **Fill the form.** Include links to your **Private Groups** (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack — your choice). These are the communication channels with Athanor & Investors.
    
5. **Review.** In the **Review** section, confirm everything is accurate.
    
6. **Run GemScore.** Use your **GemScore Pass** or purchase one. You can also pick a **subscription** if you plan frequent iterations. _(Early adopters have discounts until Nov 2025 — ask support for promo codes.)_
    
7. **AI evaluation.** **GemSeeker AI (GSAI)** analyzes your inputs.
    
8. **Score outcome.**
    - **< 40:** follow the recommendations and **request a rescore** (included with subscriptions).
    - **≥ 40:** purchase the **Explorer Pass** and **publish to Abyss**.
        
9. **After publishing.** Your project now has a **Data Room**. You can wait for reactions (views/likes) or proceed to create your first **Tokenized Promise**.

## 3) What do the Launchpad form sections expect?

- **Overview.** One‑liner, category, stage, social links.
    
- **Solution.** Problem statement, Mission & vision, GTM, monetization.
    
- **Expertise.** Why you/your team can win: domain/technical edge; past wins.
    
- **Founder.** Links to social network profiles (Linkedin preferred). Add co-founders.
    
- **Market.** ICP, TAM/SAM/SOM, Growth.
    
- **Competitors.** Your wedge: speed, cost, UX, distribution, proprietary data.
    
- **Financials.** CAC/LTV assumptions, past funding, cap table.
    
- **Additional.** Business plan, why now, personal story.
    
- **Funding Goal.** Reasoning. 
    
- **Promo.** Public‑safe assets: logo, short video, private groups.
    
- **Review.** Final check; confirm links and private group invites work.

---

## 4) What instruments can I offer?

- **Revenue‑Share** — Investors receive a % of **Net Revenue** with a set **cadence** (monthly/quarterly), optional **ROI cap**, and **minimum payout threshold**.
    
- **Equity** — **Direct Equity** (fixed equity %) or **SAFE‑like**, **and we also support SAFT**. Choose **post‑money** or **pre‑money** SAFE‑style terms, with **cap/discount**, optional **pro‑rata** and **MFN**.

**Recommendation:** For **micro‑SaaS** and **AI‑powered projects** that can generate revenue within weeks/months, **Revenue‑Share** is usually the simplest and fastest path.

---

## 5) What are the fees?

- **Issuance fee — 2%** on the entry event.
- **Success fee — 7%** on **one** event: either **Escrow → Founder** **or** **Revenue → Investors**.
- **Allocation, not duplication.** For each event, split the fee between Founder and Investors so the **parts add up to the fee** (e.g., **3% + 4%**). The split is enforced by the protocol.

---

## 6) How do I create my Tokenized Promise (TP) in the Wizard?

1. **Pick one instrument** (Revenue‑Share or Equity/SAFE/SAFT).
    
2. **Set caps & timing.** **Soft/Hard Cap** and **Raise Window**.
    
3. **Define Milestones.** Title, objective evidence, deadline, **max unlock %**.
    
    - Up to **10** milestones; **3 minimum**.
        
    - If your SPV isn’t formed yet, start with **incorporation**.
        
4. **Choose distribution logic** (Revenue‑Share only): cadence, minimum payout threshold, holdback % × days, optional ROI cap.
    
5. **Compliance (UCV).** QI‑only toggle, **U.S. exemption** or **N/A (blocks U.S.)**, jurisdiction blocks, min/max investors, min/max ticket size, transfer rules, legends.
    
6. **Fee allocation** and **Sensitive‑Access ticket threshold**.
    
7. **Deploy.** Complete KYC, sign from your **non‑custodial TON wallet**.

---

## 7) What are good Milestones — and what should I avoid?

**Good:** verifiable, objective, value‑creating.

- “**Production launch** with ≥ N paying accounts.”
- “Downloads N thousands by X date; 4‑week retention ≥ 30%.”
- “**$N MRR in a rolling 30‑day window.”

**Avoid:** vague claims, vanity metrics, or milestones that release 100% at once. Keep windows **30–90 days** and spread unlocks across **3–6** milestones.

> Note: **Investors may request changes** in a Private Group. A change only applies if **you consent** and the **holder threshold** in your TPA is met. CoA implements approved changes during open beta.

---

## 8) Can I spend funds before the SPV is verified?

Yes, with guardrails. Up to **20% of gross raised** can be paid **direct‑to‑vendor** (e.g., formation, required setup) if **you** and the **holder threshold** approve. CoA executes this during open beta.

---

## 9) What happens after Soft Cap?

- **Escrow freezes** pending SPV verification.
- After verification, you can start requesting **Milestone unlocks** with evidence.
- If you **breach beyond the cure window** (e.g., miss a deadline), CoA can **pause releases** and coordinate **pro‑rata refunds** of remaining Escrow (after fees).

---

## 10) How do distributions work (Revenue‑Share)?

- When Net Revenue is verified, the protocol opens **Pull‑Claim**.
- Holders claim on‑chain.
- If you have a **holdback**, the retained portion auto‑releases after the set period.
- If you generate revenue, **you must send the agreed share back to the contract** so it can be distributed.

---

## 11) What compliance settings should I care about most?

- **U.S. posture:** choose a path (e.g., **Reg D 506(b)/(c)**, **Reg S**, **Reg CF via portal**). If **U.S. Exemption = N/A**, **U.S. investors are blocked** and you must avoid U.S. solicitation.
    
- **QI gating:** turn **QI‑only** on if you need it.
    
- **Min/Max investors & ticket size:** enforce your policy or exemption limits.
    
- **Jurisdiction blocks:** add any countries beyond the platform defaults.
    
- **Transfers:** keep disabled at launch; if enabled later, require KYC/QI and whitelisted wallets.

_You control the toggles; you are responsible for the legal obligations of the path you pick (filings, disclosures, verification, legends)._

---

## 12) I don’t have a dev team or GTM muscle. Can Athanor help?

- **Venture Studio (optional):** we can co‑build for **5–15% sweat equity** or for **cash**.
- **Marketplace:** hire **Advisors** for GTM, fundraising, legal, certifications, or a **white‑label** implementation.

---

## 13) What is the Sensitive‑Access ticket threshold?

A minimum **aggregate ticket** you set that gives an Investor the **right to request** sensitive information via your **Secured Portal**.

**Tips:** choose a level that includes serious investors (e.g., top N by ticket), define exactly **what they see** (dashboards, redacted contracts, invoices, repo tags), and set a **response SLA** (e.g., **5–10 business days**). Watermark and log access; you may redact trade secrets or privileged items.

---

## 14) What if I’m building under Shariah rules?

Enable the **Shariah Module** and pick **Musharakah** (default). Profits share by an agreed ratio; **losses track capital shares**; no **riba / excessive uncertainty / gambling** and exclude prohibited sectors. You can value non‑cash contributions (time/services/IP) **upfront** if you document them. You may appoint a **Shariah Advisor**.

---

## 15) What are common mistakes Founders make?

- **Vague milestones** → use objective, verifiable evidence.
    
- **Forgetting U.S. gating** → set **U.S. Exemption = N/A** if you’re not using an exemption.
    
- **No Sensitive‑Access plan** → set the threshold and SLA before launch.
    
- **Using funds off‑plan** → stick to your **Use of Proceeds**; keep receipts.
    
- **Over‑raising** → set caps **only** for what you need to hit the next milestones.
    
- **Implied endorsements** → never suggest Athanor endorses or guarantees results.

## 16) Any security or incident contacts?

Yes — **[coa@athanor.market](mailto:coa@athanor.market)** for security/abuse. We may **pause features** or **migrate contracts** to protect users if needed.

---

**Deploy your TP**, invite investors, respond to feedback, and hit your milestones. When revenue starts, **send the agreed share to the smart contract** so holders can claim.
