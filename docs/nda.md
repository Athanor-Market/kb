# Global Mutual NDA

**Last Updated:** 23 August 2025

**Effective Date.** The earlier of (a) the date you click “I agree,” create an account, open a data room, view a listing, request or provide advisory services, or otherwise access non‑public materials on the Platform, or (b) the first disclosure or access to Confidential Information under this Agreement.

**Parties.**  
(i) **Athanor Market, Inc.**, a Delaware corporation (“**Athanor**,” the “**Platform**,” or the “**Protocol**”), which operates an over‑the‑counter marketplace and provides technical capabilities for Tokenized Promise issuance and administration **but does not itself issue Tokenized Promises**; and (ii) each registered **Founder**, **Investor**, and **Advisor** (each, a “**User**,” and together with Athanor, the “**Parties**”). This is a **mutual** agreement — any Party may be a **Discloser** or a **Recipient**.

---

## 1) Purpose

To enable Founders, Investors, Advisors, and Athanor to **evaluate opportunities**, conduct **due diligence**, and for Athanor to **provide platform and protocol services** — including data rooms, workspace messaging, AI‑assisted analyses and reports, KYC/AML checks, payment and wallet integrations, and the **technical capabilities** that allow Founders’ SPVs to **issue and administer** Tokenized Promises (TPs).

---

## 2) Key Definitions

- **Advisor** — a User who offers services directly to a Founder via the Platform (e.g., legal, product, marketing, technical).
    
- **Confidential Information** — all non‑public information disclosed in connection with the Purpose, including: metrics; financials; business and token economics; product plans and roadmaps; code, models and technical documentation; private groups, chats and data rooms; customer, supplier and pricing data; legal/compliance materials; and **Advisor Work Product**. Marking “Confidential” is encouraged but **not required**; a reasonable person standard applies.
    
- **Advisor Work Product** — deliverables created by an Advisor for a Founder that are not otherwise public. Ownership of such deliverables is determined by the applicable Founder‑Advisor services agreement; regardless of ownership, the content and underlying facts are **Confidential Information** here.
    
- **Representatives** — a Party’s employees, contractors and professional advisors bound by obligations **no less protective** than this Agreement.
    
- **Third‑Party Providers** — integrated service providers used by Athanor to deliver the Platform/Protocol (e.g., hosting, KYC/AML, payments, analytics, AI model providers).
    
- **Opportunity** — a specific listing, data room or engagement identified on the Platform relating to a Founder project or TP.

## 3) Scope of Confidentiality

### 3.1 Use Limitation

Recipient will use Confidential Information **solely** for the Purpose and not for competitive analysis, reverse engineering, or any use outside the specific Opportunity without Discloser’s written consent.

### 3.2 Standard of Care

Recipient will protect Confidential Information with at least **reasonable care** and no less than the care it uses for its own information of similar sensitivity, including access controls and need‑to‑know restrictions.

### 3.3 Exclusions

Confidential Information does **not** include information that the Recipient can demonstrate:  
(a) became public through no breach;  
(b) was known to Recipient without duty of confidentiality;  
(c) was independently developed without use of Discloser’s Confidential Information; or  
(d) was rightfully received from a third party without duty of confidentiality.

### 3.4 No Residuals

No “residuals” rights — unaided memory does **not** grant any right to use Confidential Information.

### 3.5 No License

Except for the limited rights expressly stated, no license or other rights (by implication, estoppel or otherwise) are granted.

---

## 4) Permitted Disclosures

Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to:  
(a) its **Representatives** with a need to know;  
(b) **Third‑Party Providers** integrated into the Platform/Protocol to deliver services for the Purpose;  
(c) an **Advisor** engaged by a Founder via the Platform, strictly as needed to perform the Advisor’s services; and  
(d) government or regulatory authorities **as required by law**.

Where legally permitted, Recipient will give **prompt notice** of compulsory disclosure and reasonably cooperate to seek protective treatment.

---

## 5) Data Processing Consent — Third‑Party Providers

Each User **consents** to Athanor’s **collection, use, processing and disclosure** of personal and business data to **Third‑Party Providers** — solely to deliver services described in the ToS (including AI report generation, KYC/AML checks, payment and wallet operations, analytics, hosting, and the **technical capabilities** for TP issuance and administration). Athanor may update its provider roster over time. Such processing and disclosures are **Permitted Disclosures** under this Agreement and **do not breach** confidentiality obligations.

Athanor may produce **anonymized or aggregated statistics** about Platform usage for security, performance, and product improvement — provided they do not identify a Discloser or reveal Discloser’s Confidential Information.

> **Public blockchain caution.** Wallet addresses and transactions recorded on public ledgers may be publicly visible and immutable. Do not include Confidential Information in on‑chain memo fields.

---

## 6) Advisors — Special Terms

6.1 **Role.** Advisors provide services directly to Founders. Advisors may access Founder materials solely to perform their services under the Founder‑Advisor engagement.

6.2 **Re‑use and Deliverables.** Except as otherwise permitted in the applicable Founder‑Advisor agreement, Advisors will not re‑use or disclose Founder Confidential Information for other clients or purposes. Advisors retain general know‑how that is non‑confidential and **does not disclose** Founder Confidential Information.

6.3 **Conflicts.** Advisors will disclose any **material conflicts** of interest relating to a specific Opportunity and will not access competing data rooms without Founder’s consent if such access creates a conflict under applicable professional standards.

---

## 7) Non‑Circumvention — 12 Months

For **twelve (12) months** after first access to a specific Founder’s Confidential Information in connection with an Opportunity:

- **Investors** and **Advisors** will not circumvent the Platform/Protocol to consummate **substantially the same Opportunity** directly with that Founder **outside** the Platform/Protocol.
    
- **Founders** will not circumvent the Platform/Protocol to consummate **substantially the same Opportunity** directly with those Investors or Advisors **outside** the Platform/Protocol.

**Carve‑outs** — (i) bona fide **pre‑existing relationships** documented in writing before first access; (ii) **general solicitations** not targeted at a specific counterparty; (iii) transactions **unrelated** to the Opportunity; or (iv) Athanor’s **written consent**.

---

## 8) Return, Destruction, and Retention

Upon Discloser’s request, Recipient will **promptly** return or destroy Confidential Information and confirm destruction in writing if requested, except that:

- one **archival copy** may be retained for legal compliance and dispute resolution; and
- data stored in routine backups may be overwritten per standard retention cycles.

---

## 9) No Duty to Proceed; No Warranties

No Party is obligated to proceed with any transaction or Opportunity. All Confidential Information is provided **“as is”** — with no express, implied, or statutory warranties (including accuracy, completeness, fitness, or non‑infringement).

---

## 10) Compliance, Sanctions, and Export Controls

Each Party will comply with applicable laws, including anti‑bribery, anti‑money‑laundering, sanctions and export control laws. Users located in or ordinarily resident in jurisdictions **blocked under the ToS** may not use the Platform/Protocol. No Party will cause another to violate applicable sanctions or export restrictions.

---

## 11) Remedies; Equitable Relief

Breach of confidentiality or non‑circumvention obligations may cause **irreparable harm** — monetary damages may be inadequate. Discloser is entitled to **injunctive relief** and specific performance, in addition to other remedies available at law or in equity.

---

## 12) Term and Survival

This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues for **five (5) years** from the **last disclosure** of Confidential Information. Obligations regarding **trade secrets** survive as long as the information remains a trade secret under applicable law. Sections 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 also survive termination.

---

## 13) Relationship to ToS, Listings, and TPA

This Agreement **supplements** the ToS and any Listing‑specific terms or Tokenized Promise Agreement. If there is a conflict **solely regarding** data processing or permitted disclosures **necessary** to deliver Platform/Protocol services, the ToS and published privacy notices prevail; otherwise, the **more protective** confidentiality obligation governs.

> **Clarification on TPs.** Athanor **provides technical capabilities** that allow Founders’ SPVs to issue and administer Tokenized Promises — Athanor is **not the issuer** of any TP and has no fiduciary duty to Investors or Founders.

---

## 14) Assignment and Successors

No assignment without prior written consent, **except** that either Party may assign to a successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided the successor assumes all obligations herein.

---

## 15) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the **State of Delaware** — conflicts rules excluded. Disputes shall be resolved by **binding arbitration** administered by the **AAA Commercial Rules**, seat **Wilmington, Delaware**, language **English**. Either Party may seek **temporary injunctive relief** in Delaware state or federal courts to preserve the status quo pending arbitration. **Class‑action waivers** apply to the extent permitted by law.

---

## 16) Notice

Notices are effective when sent to the email address in a Party’s account settings, or to **[legal@athanor.market](mailto:legal@athanor.market)** for Athanor. Legal notices of claims must also be delivered by recognized courier to a Party’s last known business address where available.

---

## 17) Entire Agreement, Amendments, Severability, Waiver

This is the **entire agreement** on confidentiality and non‑circumvention for the Purpose and **supersedes** prior NDAs among the Parties relating to the same Opportunity. Amendments must be (i) a mutually signed writing, or (ii) a **posted update** by Athanor with **advance notice** and **prospective** effect only. If any provision is unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder will continue in full force. Failure to enforce is **not** a waiver.

---

## 18) Acceptance — Clickwrap

You accept these terms by creating an account, clicking “I agree,” posting or viewing a listing or data room, requesting or providing advisory services, or otherwise accessing Confidential Information on the Platform. **No ink or e‑signature is required.**
