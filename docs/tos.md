# Athanor — Master Terms of Service

**OTC marketplace & protocol**  
**Last updated:** 15 October 2025

**Operator.** **Athanor Market, Inc.** (Delaware, USA) (“**Athanor**,” “**we / us / our**”). We operate an **over‑the‑counter (OTC)** marketplace and protocol that helps founders, investors, and advisors collaborate around GemSeeker AI, Tokenized Promises and related tools.

By creating an account, opening or viewing a **Data Room**, purchasing any pass or membership, **Listing** a project in the Abyss, using the **Tokenized Promise Wizard**, contributing to a Tokenized Promise, ordering Advisor services, or accessing any non‑public area, **you agree** to these Terms of Service (“**Terms**”).

---

## 0) Glossary — quick definitions (used consistently below)

- **Athanor (Platform / Protocol).** The OTC web application and smart‑contract tooling we operate.
    
- **Project.** A founder’s idea, initiative or venture tracked on Athanor.
    
- **Data Room.** The **project page** for a listed Project. **Only signed‑in (authorized) users** can access Data Rooms. Within a Data Room, **most sections are public to authorized users**, but some sections are **private** (for example, **Metrics**, **Private Groups**, diligence files, and any items the Founder marks as private).
      
- Abyss — the public discovery area for the listed Projects
    
- **Listing (verb).** The **action** of publishing a Project into **Abyss** 
    
- **Tokenized Promise (TP).** A smart‑contract agreement created and **issued by the Founder’s SPV** that encodes funding, **Milestone‑based escrow releases**, and revenue‑share or other payout logic. **Athanor does not issue TPs** — we provide the technical capabilities only.
    
- **Tokenized Promise Wizard.** The post‑Listing configuration flow where the Founder defines TP economics, **Milestones**, caps, timelines, and disclosures.
    
- **Milestone.** A condition **defined in the TP** by the Founder that, once verified, unlocks funds from escrow **up to a stated cap**.
    
- **Milestone Change.** Investors **may request** Milestone changes in a **Private Group**. If the **Founder consents** and **the required holder consent is obtained** (currently **unanimous consent of all invested TP unit holders**, unless the TP specifies another threshold), the protocol may **upgrade** Milestones — executed **manually by CoA** during open beta and by **protocol governance** (majority vote or the threshold specified in the TP) when enabled.
    
- **Soft Cap / Hard Cap.** Minimum / maximum raise targets set in the TP via the Wizard.
    
- **Pull‑Claim.** Distributions made available for holders to **claim** after verification events.
    
- **CoA (Committee / Circle of Alchemists).** Athanor’s safety and operations committee that verifies evidence during open beta and can perform **security migrations** without changing economic terms.
    
- **GemSeeker AI.** Athanor’s **multi‑agent** analysis system used for due diligence.
    
- **GemScore Report (GSR).** The output of GemSeeker AI — a **0–100 index** derived from **10 weighted factors**, a narrative report, and (for certain plans) an **Investor Memo** with factor‑level guidance. We describe AI Due Diligence once here; below we say **GSR**.
    
- **Advisor.** A user offering paid services directly to Founders (e.g., product, legal, marketing, security).
    
- **Third‑Party Providers.** Integrated services we use to operate the Platform (hosting, KYC/AML, payments, analytics, AI model providers).
    
- **Prohibited Jurisdictions.** At minimum, the Russian Federation, North Korea, and Iran, and any location restricted by applicable sanctions or export controls.

---

### TL;DR (not a substitute for the Terms)

- We are an **OTC platform & protocol** — we provide software and workflows; **we do not issue TPs** or give investment advice.
    
- **Data Rooms are accessible only to authorized (signed‑in) users.** Within them, some sections are **private** (Metrics, Private Groups, and other marked areas) and others are visible to all authorized users.
    
- **GSR** is an AI‑assisted **opinion**, not a recommendation or guarantee.
    
- **KYC/AML is required** for Founders (to list), Investors (to invest and claim), and Advisors (to list services).
    
- **Fees:** Issuance **2%** and Success **7%** — **a single fee per event** that can be **allocated** between Founder and Investor in **any proportion** they agree (for example, 1% + 1% issuance, or 3% + 4% success).
    
- **Milestones are defined by the Founder in the TP.** Investors **can request** changes in a Private Group; if **all required parties agree**, CoA can upgrade now and governance will handle it later.
    
- **Refunds:** before Soft Cap, investors can withdraw; after Soft Cap, refunds may occur **if the Founder breaches** (e.g., misses a deadline by more than the TP’s cure window).
    
- Platform is **experimental / open beta** — **high risk**, **no guarantees**. We may **pause, delist, or migrate** contracts for security.

---

## 1) What Athanor is — and is not

- **OTC platform & protocol.** We provide software, smart‑contract tooling, and operational workflows that let Founders publish Data Rooms, **List** Projects into Abyss, configure TPs via the **Tokenized Promise Wizard**, and collaborate with Investors and Advisors.
    
- **We do not issue TPs.** Issuers are Founders’ SPVs. We provide the **technical capabilities** and operations support only.
    
- **No regulated advice or brokerage.** We are **not** a broker‑dealer, investment adviser, exchange, ATS, custodian, escrow agent, or fiduciary. All content — including **GSR**, Investor Memos, scores, and rankings — is **informational** and **not** a recommendation, solicitation, or guarantee.

---

## 2) Services covered by these Terms

1. **GemScore Report (GSR).** Available to all users. GemSeeker AI runs a **multi‑agent, 10‑factor, weighted** analysis and produces a numeric score and report, plus an Investor Memo where applicable.
    
2. **TP enablement for Founders.** Listing into Abyss, then configuring the TP via the **Tokenized Promise Wizard** (economics, **Milestones**, caps, timelines, disclosures).
    
3. **TP support for Investors.** Non‑custodial flows to contribute stablecoins, claim distributions via **Pull‑Claim** when available, view statements, on-chain governance, and export records — coming soon, under development.
    
4. **Advisor add‑on marketplace.** Discovery and payment rails for services **directly** between Founders and Advisors. Athanor facilitates, but is **not** a party to those engagements.

Some protocol actions are executed manually by **CoA** during open beta — for example, Milestone verification, distribution triggers, and security migrations — to protect users while automation is finalized.

---

## 3) Eligibility, KYC/AML, and sanctions

- **Age & capacity.** You must be **18+** and able to enter a binding contract.
- **Sanctions & geoblocks.** Do **not** use the Platform from **Prohibited Jurisdictions**.
- **KYC/AML.**
    - **Founders** — required to List Projects and configure TPs.
    - **Investors** — required to invest and to claim distributions.
    - **Advisors** — required to publish services.  
        We use integrated providers (for example, Sumsub). If checks fail or risk is detected, we may pause, refuse, or terminate access.


---

## 4) Accounts, security, visibility, and communications

- Keep credentials secure; you are responsible for actions under your account.
    
- **Data Rooms require sign‑in.** Within a Data Room, treat all **public sections** as visible to all authorized users; use **private sections** (Metrics, Private Groups, restricted files) for sensitive items.
    
- We may send notices by email and in‑app channels. You can manage marketing preferences separately.
    
- If you suspect account compromise, contact support immediately.

---

## 5) Payments, currencies, rails, and refunds

- **Platform services** (for example, GSR runs, passes, Advisor orders) can be paid in **USD**, **USDT‑TON**, or other crypto using conversion services you select. You are responsible for their fees and terms.
    
- **Investments into TPs** are made **only in USDT‑TON**, typically from a **non‑custodial wallet** or via withdrawal from a compatible exchange. We do **not** custody your assets.
    
- **Gas / network fees** are paid by users.
    
- **Platform refunds.** Platform fees are generally **non‑refundable**.
    
- **Investment withdrawals and refunds.**
    
    - **Before Soft Cap** — Investors may withdraw contributed funds at any time (minus gas and already‑incurred fees).
        
    - **After Soft Cap** — Funds are in escrow. Refunds may be made if the **Founder breaches** the TP (for example, **missing a Milestone deadline** by more than the cure window defined in the TP), or as otherwise provided in the TP. CoA may pause releases and coordinate pro‑rata refunds of remaining escrow.
        
- **Taxes.** You are responsible for your own taxes and reporting.

---

## 6) Fees and allocation

- **Issuance fee — 2%** on TP creation / investor entry, as applicable.
- **Success fee — 7%** on **one** of the following **events**:
    - Movement of funds from TP escrow to the Founder’s wallet, **or**
    - Distributions from revenue to Investors.
- **Advisor marketplace fee — 8%** on Advisor orders transacted via the Platform.
    
- **Allocation, not duplication.** Issuance and Success fees are **single fees per event** that can be **allocated** between Founder and Investor in **any proportion** they agree. The **sum of allocations equals the fee** (for example, **1% + 1%** issuance; **7% + 0%** or **3% + 4%** success). The agreed split must be recorded in the Data Room or deal space before execution and will be applied by the protocol at settlement.
    
- For the **latest pricing** of passes and investor tiers, consult the **in‑app purchase pages** (GemScore Pass, Explorer Pass, Investor Cabinet). We may update fee types or rates prospectively with notice; changes do not apply retroactively to completed transactions.

---

## 7) Tokenized Promises — rules you should know

- **Issuer.** The Issuer is the Founder’s **SPV** — not Athanor.
    
- **Source of truth.** Rights and obligations are defined by the TP and its schedules configured via the **Tokenized Promise Wizard**.
    
- **Milestones.** Defined in the TP by the Founder. **Investors can request changes** in a **Private Group**; if **Founder consents** and **the required holder consent** is obtained (currently **unanimous**, unless the TP specifies a threshold), **CoA** may upgrade now; **protocol governance** (majority vote or the threshold in the TP) may handle it later.
    
- **Pre‑legal period.** After Soft Cap, escrow is **frozen** until SPV formation is confirmed, except for tightly controlled vendor payments as permitted in the TP.
    
- **Verification.** During open beta, **CoA** validates evidence and triggers state changes in good faith.
    
- **Distributions.** At launch, distributions use **Pull‑Claim** — Investors initiate claims when available.
    
- **Upgrades and migrations.** CoA may migrate contracts for **security, performance, or maintenance** without changing economic terms. Any change affecting rights or economics requires the consent thresholds set in the TP.
    
- **Secondary transfers.** Disabled at launch. If enabled later, transfers will require KYC and eligibility checks and may be limited to whitelisted wallets.
    
- **Lost keys.** We cannot recover your private keys. Where technically feasible, CoA may propose a holder‑approved migration that preserves balances.

---

## 8) Market‑integrity and anti‑abuse rules

To keep the OTC marketplace safe, **you must not**:

- **Scam, defraud, or “take the money and run.”** Examples include: fabricating metrics or evidence; misrepresenting customers or revenue; misusing funds released from escrow; failing to use funds as represented; refusing reasonable evidence requests; or deliberately stalling verification to avoid distributions.
    
- **Bypass controls.** No attempts to circumvent KYC/AML, geoblocks, or transfer restrictions; no operating multiple accounts to evade limits.
    
- **Manipulate the market.** No wash trading, matched orders, or coordination designed to fake demand or misprice instruments.
    
- **Misuse Data Rooms.** No scraping or exporting non‑public content, Metrics, Private Groups, or reports outside permitted use.
    
- **Security violations.** No malware, credential stuffing, DDoS, probing, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
    
- **Illegal content or activity.** No content that is unlawful, defamatory, infringing, or incites violence or hate.
    
- **Advisor‑specific.** Advisors must disclose material conflicts, avoid unauthorized claims, and keep non‑public materials confidential.
    
- **Founder‑specific.** Founders must maintain accurate books and records for TPs, provide timely evidence for Milestones and revenue, and disclose material changes promptly.
    
- **Investor‑specific.** Investors must fund from lawful sources, not coerce Founders or Advisors, and not present their opinions as Athanor endorsements.

**Enforcement.** We may **pause Data Rooms or Listings, freeze protocol actions, cancel not‑yet‑finalized transactions, block or delist accounts or wallets, withhold or claw back incentives, notify counterparties, and escalate to authorities** where fraud or abuse is suspected or detected. Fees are **non‑refundable** in cases of breach or fraud.

---

## 9) GemScore Report (GSR) — scope and limits

- **Informational only.** GSR, the Investor Memo, and factor‑level guidance are **opinions**, not promises. They can be wrong, incomplete, or become outdated.
    
- **Inputs matter.** You are responsible for the accuracy and legality of all inputs (forms, decks, links, videos, audios).
    
- **Version history.** We may maintain diffs and histories for transparency and auditability.
    
- **No exclusivity.** Running a GSR does not grant exclusivity over ideas or prevent others from building similar products.

---

## 10) Advisor marketplace

- **Direct relationship.** Advisors provide services **directly to Founders** under their own contracts. Athanor is not a party and does not supervise the work.
    
- **Access to materials.** Advisors may access Founder materials only as needed and must respect confidentiality.
    
- **Deliverables & IP.** Ownership of deliverables is defined in the Founder‑Advisor contract. Regardless, non‑public materials must remain confidential.
    
- **Payments & disputes.** Orders are processed via the Platform and are subject to the **Advisor marketplace fee**. Scope or quality disputes are primarily between Founder and Advisor; Athanor may intervene for platform safety.

---

## 11) Founder covenants, evidence, and right to audit

- **Covenants.** By Listing and configuring a TP, the Founder and Issuer covenant that:
    
    1. all Data Room and TP materials are **true, accurate, and not misleading**;
    2. funds released from escrow will be used **only** for the purposes disclosed in the TP;
    3. **books and records** will be kept for the TP;
    4. **material changes** will be promptly disclosed in the Data Room;
    5. they will **cooperate** with verification requests by CoA.
        
- **Right to request evidence.** Athanor or CoA may **request evidence at any time** (not only on suspicion), including but not limited to bank statements, processor reports, invoices, repository logs, analytics dashboards, signed attestations, or other reasonable materials.
    
- **Right to audit.** Athanor or CoA may conduct a **reasonable audit** of the Issuer relating to a TP upon notice. Failure to provide evidence or to cooperate may result in **pausing releases**, **delisting**, and **pro‑rata refunds** of remaining escrow where appropriate.

---

## 12) Privacy and data processing

- We process personal and business data to operate the Platform — including identity checks, payments, analytics, hosting, **GSR** generation, and TP enablement — and share data with **Third‑Party Providers** for these purposes.
    
- Public blockchains are **public and immutable**; do not include sensitive data in on‑chain memo fields.
    
- See our **Privacy Policy** for details, rights, and contacts.

---

## 13) Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)

- We welcome good‑faith security research. Email coa@athanor.market.
    
- **Safe harbor** — if you: (i) act in good faith; (ii) avoid privacy violations, service disruption, and data destruction; (iii) do not exfiltrate more data than needed to prove a finding; and (iv) give us **reasonable time to remediate** before public disclosure — we will not pursue legal action based solely on your research.
    
- **Out of scope** — social engineering, denial‑of‑service, and physical attacks. Obtain written consent before testing non‑production systems.

---

## 14) Incident response and user notice

- We maintain internal **incident‑response procedures**. For **material security incidents** affecting your data or funds, we will provide **prompt notice** as practicable and in accordance with law (subject to lawful law‑enforcement holds). We may temporarily **pause features** or **migrate contracts** to protect users.

---

## 15) Beta status, experimental nature, and availability

- The Platform is **experimental** and in **open beta** — features may change, and some actions are executed manually by **CoA**.
    
- We aim for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. We may pause features for maintenance, security, or compliance. **Use at your own risk.**

---

## 16) Legal posture and broad disclaimers

- **No advice.** Nothing on Athanor is investment, legal, accounting, or tax advice.
    
- **No fiduciary duty.** We are not your agent, trustee, or fiduciary.
    
- **Third‑party services.** Your use of exchanges, wallets, and conversion services is subject to their terms; we are not responsible for their acts or omissions.
    
- **As‑is.** Services are provided **as is** and **as available** without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
    
- **Regulatory uncertainty.** Digital‑asset and crowdfunding rules vary by jurisdiction and may change; you are responsible for your own compliance and eligibility.

---

## 17) Specific risk disclosures (non‑exhaustive)

- **Total loss risk.** You could lose all funds contributed to a TP.
    
- **Stablecoin / network risk.** USDT and bridging mechanisms can fail; fees and confirmations can change; chain halts or forks may disrupt operations.
    
- **Smart‑contract risk.** Bugs or vulnerabilities — including in upgrades — may cause delays or losses.
    
- **Oracle / verification risk.** Evidence can be wrong or delayed; CoA decisions in good faith drive triggers during beta.
    
- **Founder execution risk.** The Issuer may fail to meet Milestones or generate revenue; demand estimates can be inaccurate.
    
- **Counterparty and fraud risk.** Users can misrepresent facts. We work to reduce this risk but cannot eliminate it.
    
- **Key management risk.** If you lose access to your wallet, we cannot recover your keys.
    
- **Operational risk.** Outages, cyberattacks, and third‑party failures may affect availability.

---

## 18) Enforcement, suspension, and termination

We may **suspend or terminate** accounts, Data Rooms, Listings, or protocol actions — and take any protective step described in Section 8 — if you violate these Terms, fail KYC/AML, present compliance or security risk, or upon lawful request by authorities. Certain provisions survive termination, including Sections 5–7 and 11–22.

---

## 19) Indemnity

You agree to **indemnify and hold harmless** Athanor, its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your content or conduct; (b) your violation of these Terms or law; (c) your engagements with other users; or (d) your use of third‑party services.

---

## 20) Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- We will **not** be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenues, goodwill, data, or use.
    
- Our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the services will not exceed the **total fees you paid to Athanor** for the services giving rise to the claim in the **twelve months** before the event.
    
- Nothing limits liability for fraud, willful misconduct, or where law does not allow limitation.

---

## 21) Dispute resolution, governing law, and venue

- **Governing law — Delaware, USA.**
    
- **Arbitration.** Disputes are resolved by **binding arbitration** under the **AAA Commercial Rules**, seat **Wilmington, Delaware**, language **English**.
    
- **Equitable relief.** Either party may seek temporary injunctive relief in Delaware state or federal courts to preserve the status quo pending arbitration.
    
- **Class‑action waiver.** Disputes must be brought on an individual basis to the extent permitted by law.

---

## 22) Brand and marketing guidelines

- **Athanor’s marks.** You may not use our name, logos, or brand assets without prior written permission.
    
- **Project references.** We may reference **public portions** of Data Rooms and publicly Listed Projects in product materials and case studies. Founders may request **opt‑out** for future marketing uses via support, except where the Data Room content is already public to authorized users and the reference is purely descriptive (for example, search index, category page).
    
- **No endorsement.** Do not suggest Athanor endorses or guarantees any Project, investment, or Advisor.

---

## 23) Region‑specific disclaimers

- **General.** TPs and certain features are **not offered where prohibited**. You are responsible for determining whether your participation is legal in your jurisdiction and for meeting any eligibility requirements.
    
- **United States. Participation may be restricted by federal or state law and by your investor status.
    
- **United Kingdom / EEA.** Participation may be restricted by local securities and crowdfunding rules; cross‑border transfers may require additional checks.
    
- **Other Regions.** Local rules may impose additional eligibility, disclosure, or transfer restrictions.
    
- We may geoblock or restrict features at our discretion to manage regulatory risk.

---

## 24) Insurance fund

There is **no insurance fund** at launch. We may explore an insurance or reserve mechanism in the future. If introduced, we will publish rules of access, funding sources, governance, and claims processing. Until then, **no insurance** is provided and you bear the risk of loss.

---

## 25) Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the revised version and, for material changes, provide notice. Changes take effect **prospectively**. Your continued use after the effective date means you accept the new Terms.

---

## 26) Notices and contact

Official notices to Athanor may be sent to legal@athanor.market and, for legal claims, by courier to our registered address. We may send notices to the email and in‑app channels associated with your account.

---

## 27) Miscellaneous

- **Assignment.** You may not assign your rights or obligations without our consent, except to a successor that assumes the Terms. We may assign to an affiliate or successor.
    
- **Entire agreement.** These Terms, plus any TP for a given Listing, are the entire agreement regarding the services.
    
- **Severability.** If a clause is unenforceable, the rest remains in effect; the clause will be modified to the minimum extent necessary.
    
- **No waiver.** Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.
    
- **Headings.** Headings are for convenience only.
