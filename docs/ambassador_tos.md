# Athanor — Ambassador Program Terms (Clean Version)

**Plain‑language, professional, and fair**  
**Last updated:** 23 August 2025

> **TL;DR** — Any user in good standing can be an **Ambassador**. You get a **unique link and code**. When an invited user signs up or makes a qualifying purchase with your link/code, you earn **20% of Athanor’s platform revenue** from that user’s fees (e.g., GemScore, Explorer Pass, Advisor marketplace fees) — **never on investment amounts, issuance, or success fees** (those are excluded from the public program). Payouts are **monthly, manual**, via **fiat or crypto**. **No investment solicitation or advice.**

---

## 1) Program nature & relationship

- **Meta program.** “Ambassador” is a program and label — **not** a separate role. Any user can join subject to these terms.
    
- **Independent actor.** You are **not** our employee, agent, broker, promoter, or fiduciary. You act on your own behalf and at your own expense.
    
- **Other policies.** The **Athanor ToS** and **Privacy Policy** continue to apply.

---

## 2) Eligibility

- **Account & KYC.** You must maintain an account in good standing and complete any **KYC/AML** we request. Minimum age 18.
    
- **Regions.** You may not participate from regions where the platform is unavailable or where the program would violate local law.
    
- **Conflicts & multiple roles.** If you have an **Advisor account**, you cannot invest from that account; open a **separate Investor** account if you choose to invest. Disclose conflicts when promoting specific projects.

---

## 3) Referral mechanics & attribution (simple by design)

- **Your tools.** We give you a **unique link and code**.
    
- **When attribution happens.** Attribution occurs when a new user **signs up** or **completes a qualifying purchase** **using your link or entering your code** at checkout.
    
- **No complex cookies.** If multiple codes are present, the **code actually entered at the action** governs.
    
- **Lifetime link.** Once attributed, the invited account remains tied to you **for future eligible purchases**, unless corrected per the rule below.
    
- **Corrections.** Within **7 calendar days** of sign‑up or first purchase, the invitee may ask support to move attribution to a different Ambassador (one‑time).
    
- **Self‑referrals & controlled entities.** You cannot earn on purchases by yourself, your company, or entities you control.

---

## 4) What earns — and what never earns

- **Eligible Platform Revenue (public program).** You earn a **commission** equal to the **Commission Rate** (Section 5) times Athanor’s **platform revenue** recognized from your invitees’ fees, including:
    
    - **GemScore** passes and subscriptions;
    - **Explorer Pass** purchases;
    - **Advisor marketplace** platform fees (we collect from Advisors).
    
- **Not eligible (public program).** No rewards on:
    - **Invested principal** or asset values;
    - **Issuance** or **Success** fees tied to Tokenized Promises;
    - Taxes, refunds/chargebacks, coupons, unpaid/failed payments, fraud, test or courtesy transactions.
      
- **VIP Addendum (optional, case‑by‑case).** For syndicates/VCs/angel groups, we may agree **in writing** to a different rate or the inclusion of issuance/success components. This **does not** apply to the public program.

---

## 5) Commission rate

- **Default Commission Rate:** **20%** of **Eligible Platform Revenue** from your invitees.
- We may change the rate **prospectively**; the current rate is displayed in your **Ambassador Panel**. Changes do **not** affect amounts already earned.

---

## 6) Payouts

- **Cadence & method.** **Monthly**, **manual** payouts in **fiat or crypto**.
    
- **Threshold & info.** We may set a **minimum payout** (e.g., $50–$100). Provide payout details and any required tax forms.
    
- **Clawbacks & negative balances.** We may net out refunds/chargebacks/fraud from future payouts. If adjustments exceed earnings, a **negative balance** carries forward.
    
- **Timing & review.** We may temporarily hold payouts to investigate suspected spam, fraud, or policy breaches.
    
- **Taxes.** You are responsible for all taxes due on your earnings.


---

## 7) Promotion rules (compliance matters)

- **No investment solicitation or advice.** Do **not** solicit investments, recommend securities, promise returns, or act as a finder.
    
- **Truthful, lawful content.** You’re **solely responsible** for your ads/posts. Include clear **referral disclosures** and risk notes where required by law.
    
- **Brand use.** Use official logos and names **as provided**; no modifications. Do not imply Athanor endorses you or any project. Promo materials are available on request.
    
- **Paid promotion controls.** No brand bidding, typo domains, impersonation, or misleading ads. We may require **pre‑approval** for paid search/social campaigns.
    
- **Private data & rooms.** Do **not** share **non‑public Data Room** content. Link only to public pages or areas accessible to authorized users.
    
- **No spam or evasion.** No bots, mass DMs, fake reviews, coupon farms, or instructions on bypassing KYC/geo‑blocks.
    
- **Your liability.** You accept full responsibility for your materials and agree to remove or edit them upon our reasonable request.

## 8) VIP pathway

- If you operate a **syndicate, VC fund, angel group, or board/community**, contact support for **VIP review**. VIPs may get customized commissions, co‑marketing, dashboards, or — by separate agreement — participation in issuance/success economics. VIP terms require a **signed addendum**.

---

## 9) Program changes & termination

- **At will.** We may modify or end the program at any time. We will honor amounts **earned through the effective date**.
    
- **For cause.** We may suspend/terminate participation immediately for fraud, spam, legal risk, or breach of these terms or the ToS. Unpaid amounts may be forfeited if termination is for material breach.
    
- **Survival.** Sections on payouts, liability, indemnity, law/venue, and definitions survive termination.

---

## 10) IP, confidentiality, and data

- **License.** We grant a **revocable, non‑exclusive** license to use Athanor marks solely to promote the program under these terms.
    
- **Confidentiality.** Treat any non‑public information (including **private Data Room** items, internal metrics, unreleased features) as confidential.
