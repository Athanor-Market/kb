# Athanor — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 23 August 2025

**Who we are.** **Athanor Market, Inc.** (1111B S Governors Ave STE 39148, Dover, DE 19904, USA) operates the Athanor OTC marketplace and protocol (“**Athanor**,” “**we / us / our**”). Contact: **[legal@athanor.market](mailto:legal@athanor.market)** • +1‑308‑281‑2784.

This Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect personal data when you use our websites, apps, and **Data Rooms**. It also describes your choices and rights. If anything here conflicts with local law, local law controls.

---

## 0) Definitions — used consistently in this Policy

- **Data Room** — the project page for a listed **Project**, accessible only to authorized (signed‑in) users. Some modules are **public to authorized users**, while others are **private** (for example, **Metrics**, **Private Groups**, diligence files).
    
- **Listing** — the act of publishing a Project into **Abyss** (the discovery area).
    
- **Tokenized Promise (TP)** — a smart‑contract obligation **issued by the Founder’s SPV**, encoding funding, **Milestone**‑based escrow releases, and revenue‑share or other payout logic. Athanor does **not** issue TPs.
    
- **Tokenized Promise Wizard** — the post‑Listing configuration flow where the Founder defines TP economics, Milestones, caps, timelines, and disclosures.
    
- **GemSeeker AI / GemScore Report (GSR)** — our due‑diligence workflow: a **multi‑agent** analysis that outputs a **0–100** score based on **10 weighted factors**, a narrative report and, for certain plans, an **Investor Memo**. Inputs can include **forms, pitch decks, video or audio**, and the system maintains **version history**; Enterprise options may include **BYOK/VPC, SSO/SCIM and audit logs**. These features are summarized in our _Pricing & features_ pages and visuals, which note **encryption in transit/at rest**, multi‑agent 10‑factor analysis, external enrichment, and version diffs.
    
- **CoA (Committee / Circle of Alchemists)** — our safety and operations committee that verifies evidence during open beta and may perform security migrations without changing economic terms.
    
- **Third‑Party Providers** — integrated services we use to operate the Platform (hosting, KYC/AML, payments, analytics, AI model providers, customer support, etc.).

---

## 1) Scope

This Policy covers personal data processed when you browse our sites, create an account, use a Data Room, request or provide Advisor services, purchase passes or memberships, configure or invest in a TP, or otherwise interact with Athanor.

---

## 2) Our roles — controller vs processor

- **Controller.** We act as a **data controller** for account profiles, authentication, billing for platform services, analytics, anti‑fraud, safety reviews, and operation of GSR.
    
- **Processor / service provider.** For content that Founders upload to their Data Rooms and for Advisor deliverables sent through the Platform, we generally act as a **processor** (or “service provider” under U.S. state laws) on behalf of the Founder or Advisor. When we act as a processor, we only process the data according to their instructions and our contract.

---

## 3) What we collect

**A) Identifiers & profile** — name; email/phone (where provided); user IDs from sign‑in providers (**Telegram, LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, X, Apple**); username/handle; profile photo/avatar.

**B) Wallets & on‑chain** — **TON** wallet addresses; transaction hashes; network metadata.

**C) KYC/AML** — government ID, selfies/biometrics, proof of address, sanctions/PEP screening outputs (via our KYC provider).

**D) Financial & transactional** — invoices, contribution amounts, payment confirmations, marketplace orders, TP unit holdings, and history.

**E) GSR inputs & outputs** — the content you submit for analysis (forms, decks, **video/audio**), external enrichment signals considered by GemSeeker AI, the resulting score, **version history**, and any **Investor Memo**. 

**F) Data Room content** — project descriptions, files, comments, **Metrics** in private modules, **Private Group** messages, and diligence artifacts.

**G) Usage, device & telemetry** — pages viewed, clicks, error logs, IP address, device type, OS/browser, time‑zone, cookie IDs, referral data.

**H) Support & communications** — messages you send to us (e.g., Intercom), tickets, and call/chat recordings when needed for quality or compliance.

We do **not** intentionally collect special categories of data (e.g., health, religion) or precise geolocation. Do not upload such information unless strictly necessary and permitted by law — if you do, you confirm you have a lawful basis to share it.

---

## 4) Where data comes from

- You, when you sign up, use the Platform, or contact support.
    
- Your connected services (social logins; KYC provider).
    
- Public blockchains, when you interact on‑chain.
    
- Third‑party analytics and telemetry tools.
    
- Other users who share content with you in a Data Room.

---

## 5) How we use personal data — purposes & legal bases

**Contract necessity** — to create and manage your account; enable Data Rooms, Listings, the Tokenized Promise Wizard, and TP transactions; generate GSR and Investor Memos; process payments and invoices; provide Advisor marketplace workflows.

**Legitimate interests** — to keep the Platform safe (fraud prevention, abuse detection); to improve services (analytics, diagnostics, testing); to produce **aggregated / anonymized** statistics; to communicate service updates.

**Legal obligations** — to perform **KYC/AML/sanctions** screening; to maintain records and respond to lawful requests.

**Consent** — for cookies/analytics where required; for marketing emails or optional features; for any use of sensitive data you choose to submit.

We do **not** make decisions with **legal or similarly significant effects** based **solely** on automated processing. GSR expresses an **opinion** about a project’s factors and may influence aspects like visibility or gating, but it is not a credit or employment decision. You may contact us to **explain or contest** a GSR outcome.

---

## 6) Cookies and similar technologies

We use cookies or local storage for sign‑in, session management, security, and analytics. In regions where required, our banner lets you manage **Necessary**, **Analytics**, and **Marketing** categories. We honor **Global Privacy Control (GPC)** signals where legally required.

---

## 7) Sharing — who sees your data

- **Third‑Party Providers** — to operate the Platform: **GCP** (hosting); **Sumsub** (KYC/AML); **Stripe** (payments for platform services); **Intercom** (support); **OpenAI** (AI features); **PostHog**, **Google Analytics**, and **Mixpanel** (analytics); and similar providers.
    
- **Other users** — Data Room content may be visible to other authorized users per the Project’s visibility settings. Use **private** modules for sensitive materials.
    
- **Advisors** — when you engage Advisors through the marketplace, we share the minimum data needed to deliver the engagement.
    
- **Founders / Investors / CoA** — transaction‑relevant information and evidence for verification, milestone unlocks, and distributions.
    
- **Legal, safety, and rights** — to comply with law, enforce our Terms, protect users and property, investigate fraud, or respond to lawful requests.
    
- **Business transfers** — as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, with appropriate safeguards.

We may publish **aggregated or de‑identified** insights that do not identify you.

---

## 8) International transfers

We process data in the **United States** and **EEA** and may transfer data internationally. Where required, we use **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** or other approved mechanisms, and we assess suppliers’ practices case by case.

---

## 9) Security

We apply layered security: encryption in transit and at rest; role‑based access; network segmentation; monitoring and logging; least‑privilege and key management; vulnerability management; and incident response. Our GSR materials also note **encryption at rest/in transit**, **version history**, and **enterprise** security options such as **BYOK/VPC** and **SSO/SCIM with audit logs** for eligible plans. These features support secure processing, though **no system is perfectly secure**.

**Vulnerability disclosure.** Report issues to coa@athanor.market. If you act in good faith and give us time to remediate before public disclosure, we will not pursue legal action based solely on your research.

---

## 10) Data on public blockchains

Wallet addresses and transactions on **TON** are **public and immutable**. Do not include confidential or personal data in on‑chain memo fields. We cannot change or delete data recorded on chain.

---

## 11) Retention

We keep data **only as long as necessary** for the purposes above or to meet legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

- **KYC/AML** — typically **5 years** after account closure (subject to law).
    
- **Contracts, invoices, and TP records** — for the statute‑of‑limitations period applicable to our services.
    
- **GSR artifacts and version history** — for the life of the Project or account and a reasonable period thereafter for auditability and product improvement. The GSR materials describe version history and diffs as part of the service.
    
- **Telemetry and logs** — for operational needs, typically months, unless extended for security investigations.

When retention ends, we delete or de‑identify data. Backups are overwritten on a rolling schedule.

---

## 12) Your choices and rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to **access**, **rectify**, **erase**, **port**, **restrict**, **object**, or **withdraw consent**, and to **appeal** a rights request decision. You can also **opt out** of marketing at any time.

- Submit requests to **[legal@athanor.market](mailto:legal@athanor.market)** with subject “Privacy Request”. We will verify your identity and respond within the timeframe required by law.
    
- If we act as a **processor** for a Founder or Advisor, we will direct you to them to fulfill your request where appropriate.
    
- You can manage certain settings — like cookie preferences — directly in the app.

**California (CPRA).** We do **not** “sell” personal information as defined by CPRA, nor do we “share” it for cross‑context behavioral advertising, but we do use analytics and may use advertising technology. Use the cookie banner or GPC to manage preferences. You may use an authorized agent to make requests if they provide proof of authority.

**EEA/UK.** You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. If we appoint an EU/UK representative, we will update this Policy.

---

## 13) Children

Athanor is **not intended for persons under 18**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a minor has provided data, contact us to delete it.

---

## 14) Your responsibilities

- Only upload content you have the right to share.
- Do not include sensitive personal data unless strictly necessary.
- Use **private** modules for sensitive materials in Data Rooms.
- Respect other users’ confidentiality obligations.

---

## 15) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the revised Policy and, where material changes occur, provide notice. Changes take effect **prospectively**. Your continued use after the effective date means you accept the new Policy.

---

## 16) Sub‑processors — current core list

We use reputable providers and review them periodically. Core providers currently include:

- **Cloud / infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- **KYC/AML:** Sumsub.

### Appendix — How GSR touches your data (informational)

- **Inputs.** You choose what to submit — text forms, decks, **video/audio**.
- **Processing.** GemSeeker AI uses **multi‑agent** debate across **10 weighted factors** and may blend your inputs with **external enrichment** (market/rivals/signals).
- **Outputs.** A **0–100** score, narrative report, and (on certain plans) an **Investor Memo**, with **version history** and factor‑level guidance. The materials note **encryption at rest/in transit** and, for enterprise, **BYOK/VPC, SSO/SCIM, audit logs, SLA, and API/webhooks**. These descriptions are summarized in the feature tables.

_We aim to protect good parties — founders, investors, and advisors acting in good faith — while preserving transparency, safety, and accountability across the Athanor ecosystem._
